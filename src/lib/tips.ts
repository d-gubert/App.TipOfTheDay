The sidebar (on the left) is the place where you can find all the current conversations you have :eyes: there's 3 presentation modes:
      * Condensed - For the ones that just want the most simple sidebar :star2:
      * Medium - You want to see more info, but not too much :star2:
      * Extended - My personal favorite: helps you see the last message on the conversation, so you can see what's happening without entering the conversation! :heart_eyes_cat:`,
